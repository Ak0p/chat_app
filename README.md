# Chat app

## The app exposes apis for: 
- **posting messages on /messages** 
- **retrieving a stream of messages on /events**
- **registering an account on /register**
- **loggin in on /login**  

> For an user to use the app they must first register with and account, log in with that account and then send messages on the /chat page. 
> The authentication was done using a JWT embedded in a cookie.  
___  
> The scope of this project was to get a grasp on async programming, REST APIS and working with databases.
> The front end was a bit of a challenge and a bit beyond of what I planned with this project.
